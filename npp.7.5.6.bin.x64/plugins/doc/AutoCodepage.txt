====================
  Why this plugin?
====================

I'm a Delphi developer and beyond writing code I'm responsible for our company's
build system which is based on old-school batch scripts. For changing and exten-
ding these scripts I use Notepad++.

One day I made some changes and after that we had a malfunction in the build
system caused by a typo related to the wrong encoding of german umlaut charac-
ters - when editing the batch script I forgot to set the correct character
encoding, OEM 850 in this case.

To secure the process of editing our build scripts I wrote this plugin to auto-
mate the encoding switching. Maybe some other batch scripters will find it use-
ful too.

To get as much flexibility as possible I made it configurable so that one can
use it not only for batch scripts on a german Windows installation.



============
  Features
============

This plugin allows you to create file classes which are defined by the related
filename extensions and (optionally) a language (s.a. menu "Languages" in Note-
pad++). For every file class you have to provide the code page to which should
be switched to when the plugin detects that the active Notepad++ document is a
member of this file class.

The plugin captures the following events in Notepad++:

  - The active tab of Notepad++ is changed.

  - The language of a file already loaded in Notepad++ is changed.

  - The file extension of a file already loaded in Notepad++ is changed.

  - A file is saved, closed or deleted (only for internal management).

When one of these events fires the plugin gets invoked. After it has verified
the membership to a certain file class it changes the code page of the active
document to the related code page of its file class, according to your settings.

NOTE: AutoCodepage only helps you to work with already existing documents. The
encoding of documents newly created in Notepad++ has to be set by the user
BEFORE writing content.
